## Facts

1. Started in Sauk City Wisconsin in 1984 Culver's has expanded to over 600 restaurants in 24 states. 

2. If you want to franchise a Culver's you must work 60 hours in a Culver's restaurant without pay, before completing 4 months of training for every job in the restaurant. All while giving Culver's 20 thousands dollars. We are looking to do something similar with Face Jam expect you don't get to own anything, and you just give us 20 thousands dollars. You're Welcome!

3. Being about as Midwest as they can Culver's is known for their cheese curds and frozen custards, but their standout dish is "Butter Burgers". In 2022 the obesity rate in Wisconsin is 34.2%.

4. Culver's frozen custards is meant to be customized with over 80 flavors of the day!? And if their anything like Sonic Burger which is not a restaurant (which is not a restaurant its just Sonic) over 1 million bad ones from weird employees.

5. In 2017 a man named Christ died of a stress induced heart attack during a robbery at a Culver's in Madison, Wisconsin. His family sued the store because they did not "Take reasonable precautions to prevent armed robberies" but probably would have more luck if they sued for serving this man burgers with butter on them like dude of course this happened.
