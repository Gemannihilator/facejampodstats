## Facts

1. Our previous Carl's Jr episode was released July 7th, 2020 where we ate the Spicy Western Bacon Cheeseburger & Angus Thickburger, it received an average score of 60.

2. In 1984 owner and founder Carl Karcher told all of his family to sell their stock before the Carl's Jr stock plummeted. The SEC charged them with insider trading fining them over 600 thousand dollars. Which is not a lot of money considering his family consisted of Karcher 12 children 51 grandchildren and 45 great grandchildren.

3. Carl Karcher loved launching restaurants with insane themes. Like Taco De Carlos mexican food place. Or Carl's Whistle Stop a railroad themed spot, where the servers dressed as conductor and severed something called the "Hobo Burger". We're not sure what that is, but we assume you have to fight a three legged dog for it.

4. In 2006 at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas you could order a combo of the Carl's Jr 6 dollar burger that came with a 6 thousand dollar bottle of french bordeaux wine.

5. In 2008 a no-poach agreement was ended when Arby's, Auntie Anne's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Carl's Jr, Cinnabon, Jimmy John's, and McDonald's eliminated the practice that prevents managers from jumping from 1 chain to another for higher pay. So finally really killing it at Auntie Anne's but want to really make your mark at Buffalo Wild Wings for $9.25 an hour you can... nobody wants to work.
