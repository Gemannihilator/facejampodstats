## Facts

1. Our previous Boston Market episode was released December 8th, 2020 where we ate the Tuscan Chicken & Chicken Marsala it received an average score of 64.

2. Originally named Boston Chicken in 1984 in the town of Newton Massachusetts, Boston Market went through a name change in 1995 and moved to Golden Colorado.

3. After filing for bankruptcy in the late 90's Boston Market was purchased by McDonald's and successfully run until they sold in 2007.

4. During its expansion in 2002 Boston Market was met with a trademark lawsuit in Canada from Boston Pizza. Sadly McDonald's owned Boston Market, lost and shuttered their Canadian restaurants in 2004.

5. Over the last 20 years the only thing Boston Market has done successfully has created a brand of freezer dinners called "Boston Market at home". A meal for the upper crust bachelor who wants a boneless short rib shaped patty from a chicken place but refuses to put down Elden Ring maidenless for real.
