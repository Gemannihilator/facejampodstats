## Facts

1. Our previous KFC episode was released December 10th, 2019 where we ate the Nashville Hot Chicken & Waffles, it received an average score of 82.

2. Although KFC is no longer special to anyone in the United States, KFC is a big Christmas tradition in Japan with holidays sales accounting for over 1/3 of the chains total revenue. This is tied with radish carving in Mexico as weirdest Christmas tradition where you should be opening presents and drinking.

3. In February of 2020 KFC partnered with Crocs to make exclusive collab shoes that sold out in minutes. The KFC X-Crocs looked like a bucket holding fried chicken with 2 fried chicken jibbitz attached. No word if the shoes make your feet smell like KFC, but we know 1 little monkey willing to find out.

4. In 2015 a Los Angeles KFC customer was served a piece of chicken that looked like a rat with its tail still attached. After the suit was filed the fried rat was tested at an independent lab and found to be...chicken. KFC like the police were able to launch an internal investigation and clear themselves of any wrong doing? I don't think so, I smell a rat.
