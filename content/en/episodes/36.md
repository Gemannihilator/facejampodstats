In this episode, Michael Jones and Jordan Cwierz eat and review Wingstop Hot Lemon, Bayou BBQ, & Lemon Garlic Wings so you know if it's worth eating. They also talk about food all over Eric's car, never going to Wingstop before.... maybe, and a favorite blue cheese. Michael's microphone is messed up but we didn't know that when we recorded this. Sorry.
