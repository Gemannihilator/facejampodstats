## Facts

1. Our previous Fazoli's episode was released October 13th, 2020 (Kyle's birthday) where we ate the Parmesan-Crusted Alfredo with Meatballs, it received an average score of 41.

2. After years of steady decline Fazoli's was sold to FAT Brands the holding company started by Fatburger. Other FAT Brand's restaurants are Hot Dog on a Stick, Round Table Pizza, Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses, and Twin Peaks. Fazoli's may be done for...

3. Fazoli's will cater your wedding or school fundraiser for about 4 dollars a person, and you can charge whatever you want because no matter what everyone is going to be mad at you for making them eat Fazoli's especially at a wedding.

4. In 2020, a department of labor suit was brought forward alleging that 40 Wendy's and Fazoli's locations broke child labor laws. By allowing 14 and 15-year-olds to work more hours than allowed by law. So if you were in Wisconsin in the last couple of years, and you thought your Fazoli's tasted a little different it's because it's no longer being made by a high school freshman at 10:30 PM.

5. As of February of this year (2022) the SEC has begun to investigate the CEO of FAT Brands, the CEO's families, and 3 directors of "looting" the company in connection with the merger. When news broke FAT Brands stock price dropped 24% and now we can only hope these millionaire get a taste of their own medicine (they should have to eat Fazoli's).
