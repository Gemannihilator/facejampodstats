# The Unofficial Face Jam Podcast Stats

### About

Fast food creations are coming out too fast to keep track of but luckily Michael Jones and Jordan Cwierz are here to eat and judge every new menu item under the sun. One has high standards. The other has no taste. This is Face Jam.

## Contribution

Main content is located within https://github.com/tcampbPPU/facejampodstats/tree/main/content/en/episodes. Any changes needed to be made to an episode will be done there, the episode number correlates to the filename: `content/en/episodes/{number}.md`.

I am looking for help getting in some of the facts and snack attack ratings. If you are able to provide info about either for a episode please provide a timestamp so I can easily verify.

You can either submit any help as a PR or a issue with this [form](https://github.com/tcampbPPU/facejampodstats/issues/new?assignees=&labels=episode&template=EPISODE-STAT.yaml&title=%5BEpisode+Statistic%5D) 

> For Example: Snack Attack Rankings at 54:00 on episode 45

Thanks!
