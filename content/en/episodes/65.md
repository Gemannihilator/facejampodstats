## Facts

1. Founded in a university of Pennsylvania dorm in 2003 Insomnia Cookies has over 200 locations all over the US offering warm cookies from: "10 AM to 3 AM".

2. Despite its name Insomnia Cookies do not have a secret ingredient which is code for weed, but they're really cute about not saying it so its tongue and cheek despite marijuana still being illegal in 34 states.

3. Insomnia Cookies is designed to be a late night treat (cause they are sure not open during the day) for college kids after studying or partying all night. Because I cannot think of something I want more when after a night of drinking more, than a heavily frosted cookie sandwich.

4. In 2018 Insomnia Cookies was acquired by JAB Holding a German conglomerate that also owns Panera and Krispy Kreme. In March 2019 a German newspaper revealed that JAB owner Albert Reimann Sr and his son [Albert Reimann Jr] were enthusiastic supporters of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party well before they took power and profited from forced labor in their industrial chemicals company in southern Germany and in their own home.

5. In 2014 64 year old Georgina Spence filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against Insomnia Cookies after being attacked in the middle of street by an employee while she walking 2 dogs.
