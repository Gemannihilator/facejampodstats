## Facts

1. Our previous Dairy Queen episode was released January 19th, 2021 where we ate the McDonald's McRib it received an average score of 75.

2. Dairy Queen a nation wide chain, has a whole different set of menus and circumstances in the great state of Texas, where they successfully tricked these yocals (Eric included) into thinking its a Texas native chain. Good luck getting this food.

3. The swirl on top of every Dairy Queen soft serve cone is trademark. So we are asking you to do your part and report any infringement ice cream top you see, it's up to all of us "If you see something Say something".

4. From 1971 to 2001 Dennis the Menace was the mascot for Dairy Queen. In the UK they also have a Dennis the Menace cartoon character who fights Walter the Softy with the help of his dog Gnasher.

5. The first DQ opened in 1940 at 501 North Chicago Street in Joliet, Illinois and is considered a landmark. So we are clear this location hasn't been a Dairy Queen since 1950 and is now a church.
