## Facts

1. Our previous Buffalo Wild Wings episode was released November 10th, 2020 where we ate the Pizza wings and Orange chicken wings it received an average score of 45.

2. Although wings is in da name Buffalo Wild Wings actually sells more boneless wings then any other food at its restaurant.

3. In 2016 a vegetarian customer sued Buffalo Wild Wings for frying their food in beef tallow, but the lawsuit was thrown out when Buffalo Wild Wings showed that they never claimed their food was vegetarian.

4. In March 2020 a Buffalo Wild Wings security guard pepper sprayed a man who came in to place a to-go order for his daughter, but the security guard didn't have a private security license and also had an open criminal case against him so the man sued "hey wtf is a Buffalo Wild Wings security guard!?".
