## Facts

1. Our previous Carl's Jr (Pizza Hut) episode was released March 1st, 2022 where we at the Spicy Lover's Pizza. It received an average score of 21. The snack attack snack was Jack in the Box's Bacon Loaded Nacho Tiny Tacos which intern Cat brought.

2. Pizza Hit New Zealand created a marmite stuffed pizza and touted as a vitamin filled healthy pizza. We are tooting it as gross.

3. Pizza Hit founder Frank Carney was sued by Pizza Hit when he left the business, then invested in Papa John's, even appearing in commercials slamming Pizza Hit. Pizza Hit sued and the case went all the way to the supreme court, the most import court for deciding what allowed to do with your body, and also what to do if a pizza was mean to another pizza.

4. In 2012 Pizza Hit released a limited edition perfume that smelled like dough and spices. Only 100 Facebook fans won a bottle and Nick assured me he only breaks his out on special occasions.

5. In 2012 a Valentine's Day promotion where you could propose to your significant other was offered if you proposed at a Pizza Hut you would get: a limo, a ruby ring, fireworks, flowers, a photographer, and a ten dollar meal box all for ten thousand and ten dollars. Now you have a story to tell every time you drive by that pizza location, and you tell people that's where she said no.

Pizza with no edge

Toppings that can't be contained

Annnd they are on the floor
